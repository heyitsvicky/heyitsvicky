### Hi there üëã

# üí´ About Me:
I'm a Computer Science and Business undergrad at Lehigh University, passionate about full-stack development and constantly exploring new technologies. Right now, I‚Äôm diving deep into front-end development, back-end technologies like Node.js and PostgreSQL, and experimenting with AI through Python. <br>

Recently, I have built the JARVIS AI from Iron Man (yes, really!) and I have earned certifications in Data Visualization and JavaScript Algorithms. I‚Äôve worked on full-stack projects like WanderWise, a travel app with Angular and Node.js, and a social media application with TypeScript, Angular, and Flutter. <br>

On top of that, I‚Äôve gained real-world experience, including a Capstone Project at Nutradata and an internship at Waital, where I helped design and develop web applications using modern technologies and frameworks. <br>

Currently looking for opportunities! I‚Äôm actively seeking a full-time job or internship in full-stack or front-end development. I‚Äôm excited to bring my skills to a team and contribute to impactful projects. <br>

Fun fact: when I‚Äôm not coding, I‚Äôm a figure skating coach! Proof that balance, precision, and creativity are key both on the ice and in development!
